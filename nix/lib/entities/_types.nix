  # Shared aspect lookup: an entity takes EVERY candidate aspect that exists,
  # most specific first, composed through `includes`.
  #
  # NOT "first match wins", and the reason is that existence cannot answer the
  # question a first-match lookup needs to ask. `modules/aspects/definition.nix`
  # registers a stub aspect per entity (`genAttrs classes (_: { })`) so an
  # entity's class keys always exist, which means `den.aspects ? <entity name>`
  # is TRUE for every declared entity whether or not anyone wrote that aspect
  # — measured: a host declared with no aspect at all still answers true. A
  # stub is also structurally indistinguishable from a written aspect (same
  # keys, `name` defaulted from the attr path, no content), so no predicate
  # over `den.aspects` can separate them.
  #
  # Composing sidesteps that entirely: a stub contributes empty class keys, so
  # including one is a no-op, and nothing has to know which is which. It also
  # gives the better semantics — a user's shared aspect and their host-specific
  # one both apply, rather than the qualified one shadowing config the author
  # can still see in their tree.
  #
  # A single present candidate is returned AS ITSELF rather than wrapped, so
  # the overwhelmingly common case keeps its own identity, name and provenance
  # exactly as before this existed.
